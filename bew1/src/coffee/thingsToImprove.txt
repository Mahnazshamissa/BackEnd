method should receive as few arguments as possible ( so maybe we should have "Bean experiment input" class
that will get the number of experiments to run and the can size)
--
Change the name of the method in Bean Processor to something like .writeStatistics
--
when making beans, to make it clearer, we could set out to generate infinite and limit by max.
--
BeanProcessor should return Experiment(or Entry)
--
When giving items to the queue we should use .offer rather than .add
--
IDENTIFY RESPONSIBILITIES!!!!

Think of what steps needs to be done to solve the problem. Those will be your basic classes.
